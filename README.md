## API Description

<fullname>AWS Organizations API Reference</fullname> <p>AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an <i>organization</i> and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.</p> <p>This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more information about using this service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html">AWS Organizations User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>API Version</b> </p> <p>This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the Organizations API version 2016-11-28.</p> <note> <p>As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Organizations. However, you also can use the Organizations Query API to make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about the Organizations Query API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_query-requests.html">Making Query Requests</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. Organizations supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access key, which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not create an access key for your root account. Anyone who has the access key for your root account has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an IAM user account that has administrative privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials, and use those credentials to sign requests. </p> <p>To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>. If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate this requirement. </p> <p>When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools.</p> <p>In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future release, a single organization will support multiple roots.</p> <p> <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations</b> </p> <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a href="mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com">feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com</a> or post your feedback and questions in the <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219">AWS Organizations support forum</a>. For more information about the AWS support forums, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums Help</a>.</p> <p> <b>Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API</b> </p> <p>For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region for all AWS API and CLI calls. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:</p> <p> <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:</p> <p> <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:</p> <p> <code>--region us-east-1</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the requests to a specific endpoint. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>How examples are presented</b> </p> <p>The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your requests is returned as a single long string without line breaks or formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in the examples in this guide to improve readability. When example input parameters also would result in long strings that would extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.</p> <p> <b>Recording API Requests</b> </p> <p>AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests were successfully made to Organizations, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration">Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>

## Authorization

Supported authorization schemes:
- API Key
## Actions

### <p>Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action proposed by the handshake request. </p> <p>This operation can be called only by the following principals when they also have the relevant IAM permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Invitation to join</b> or <b>Approve all features request</b> handshakes: only a principal from the member account. </p> <p>The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the <code>organizations:AcceptHandshake</code> permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, then the user must also have the <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> permission so that Organizations can create the required service-linked role named <i>AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</i>. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integration_services.html#orgs_integration_service-linked-roles">AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Enable all features final confirmation</b> handshake: only a principal from the master account.</p> <p>For more information about invitations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html">Inviting an AWS Account to Join Your Organization</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. For more information about requests to enable all features in the organization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">Enabling All Features in Your Organization</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>After you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that it is deleted.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Credential` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Service control policy (SCP)</b> - An SCP specifies what permissions can be delegated to users in affected member accounts. The scope of influence for a policy depends on what you attach the policy to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you attach an SCP to a root, it affects all accounts in the organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you attach an SCP to an OU, it affects all accounts in that OU and in any child OUs.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you attach the policy directly to an account, then it affects only that account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU). When you attach one SCP to a higher level root or OU, and you also attach a different SCP to a child OU or to an account, the child policy can further restrict only the permissions that pass through the parent filter and are available to the child. An SCP that is attached to a child cannot grant a permission that is not already granted by the parent. For example, imagine that the parent SCP allows permissions A, B, C, D, and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and G. The result is that the accounts affected by the child SCP are allowed to use only C, D, and E. They cannot use A or B because they were filtered out by the child OU. They also cannot use F and G because they were filtered out by the parent OU. They cannot be granted back by the child SCP; child SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from the parent SCP.</p> <p>AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named <code>"FullAWSAccess</code> to every root, OU, and account. This default SCP allows all services and actions, enabling any new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of the parent root or OU. If you detach the default policy, you must replace it with a policy that specifies the permissions that you want to allow in that OU or account.</p> <p>For more information about how Organizations policies permissions work, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html">Using Service Control Policies</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Credential` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Cancels a handshake. Canceling a handshake sets the handshake state to <code>CANCELED</code>. </p> <p>This operation can be called only from the account that originated the handshake. The recipient of the handshake can't cancel it, but can use <a>DeclineHandshake</a> instead. After a handshake is canceled, the recipient can no longer respond to that handshake.</p> <p>After you cancel a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that it is deleted.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_

* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because <code>CreateAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the <a>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</a> operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html">Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> </li> </ul> <p/> <p>The user who calls the API to create an account must have the <code>organizations:CreateAccount</code> permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations will create the required service-linked role named <code>AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</code>. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs">AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> <p>AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named <code>OrganizationAccountAccessRole</code> by default) that grants users in the master account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the master account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's master account.</p> <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.</p> <p>For more information about creating accounts, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html">Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> <important> <ul> <li> <p>When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is <i>not</i> automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info"> To leave an organization as a member account</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using CreateAccount to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html">Closing an AWS Account</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> </important> <note> <p>When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the <b>IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information</b> switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html">Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools</a>.</p> </note>

### <p>Creates an AWS organization. The account whose user is calling the CreateOrganization operation automatically becomes the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account">master account</a> of the new organization.</p> <p>This operation must be called using credentials from the account that is to become the new organization's master account. The principal must also have the relevant IAM permissions.</p> <p>By default (or if you set the <code>FeatureSet</code> parameter to <code>ALL</code>), the new organization is created with all features enabled and service control policies automatically enabled in the root. If you instead choose to create the organization supporting only the consolidated billing features by setting the <code>FeatureSet</code> parameter to <code>CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"</code>, then no policy types are enabled by default and you cannot use organization policies.</p>

### <p>Creates an organizational unit (OU) within a root or parent OU. An OU is a container for accounts that enables you to organize your accounts to apply policies according to your business requirements. The number of levels deep that you can nest OUs is dependent upon the policy types enabled for that root. For service control policies, the limit is five. </p> <p>For more information about OUs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.html">Managing Organizational Units</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.</p>

### <p>Declines a handshake request. This sets the handshake state to <code>DECLINED</code> and effectively deactivates the request.</p> <p>This operation can be called only from the account that received the handshake. The originator of the handshake can use <a>CancelHandshake</a> instead. The originator can't reactivate a declined request, but can re-initiate the process with a new handshake request.</p> <p>After you decline a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that it is deleted.</p>

### <p>Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or account. If the policy being detached is a service control policy (SCP), the changes to permissions for IAM users and roles in affected accounts are immediate.</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP attached. If you want to replace the default <code>FullAWSAccess</code> policy with one that limits the permissions that can be delegated, then you must attach the replacement policy before you can remove the default one. This is the authorization strategy of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html#orgs_policies_whitelist">whitelisting</a>. If you instead attach a second SCP and leave the <code>FullAWSAccess</code> SCP still attached, and specify <code>"Effect": "Deny"</code> in the second SCP to override the <code>"Effect": "Allow"</code> in the <code>FullAWSAccess</code> policy (or any other attached SCP), then you are using the authorization strategy of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html#orgs_policies_blacklist">blacklisting</a>. </p> <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.</p>

#### Input Parameters

* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by <code>ServicePrincipal</code>) with AWS Organizations. When you disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">service-linked role</a> in <i>new</i> accounts in your organization. This means the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from AWS Organizations.</p> <p/> <important> <p>We recommend that you disable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service.

### <p>Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can't use any of the advanced account administration features that AWS Organizations supports. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">Enabling All Features in Your Organization</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.</p> </important> <p>After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using <a>EnablePolicyType</a> and <a>DisablePolicyType</a>. To see the status of policy types in a root, use <a>ListRoots</a>.</p> <p>After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set change by accepting the handshake that contains <code>"Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"</code>. This completes the change.</p> <p>After you enable all features in your organization, the master account in the organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The master account can apply policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account administrators are aware of this.</p> <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's master account. </p>
